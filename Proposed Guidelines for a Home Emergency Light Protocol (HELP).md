## **Proposed Guidelines for a Home Emergency Light Protocol (HELP)**

Here is a proposed generic framework for a **Home Emergency Light Protocol (HELP)**, designed to be simple, intuitive, and avoid confusion with official emergency services.

### **Guiding Principles**

1. **Clarity:** Each signal must be unique and easily distinguished from decorative lighting (like for holidays) and from each other.  
2. **Intuitive Colors:** Use colors with strong, pre-existing psychological associations with specific events.  
3. **Pattern Over Color:** The flashing **pattern** is the most critical element, as it aids in differentiation and is accessible to people with color vision deficiency.  
4. **Priority Levels:** Critical, life-threatening events should have the most aggressive and attention-grabbing patterns.  
5. **Avoid Official Mimicry:** The system must avoid color combinations and patterns legally reserved for police, fire, and ambulance services (e.g., flashing red and blue together).

### **Proposed HELP Codes**

| Emergency Event | Color(s) | Pattern & Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| üî• **Fire / Smoke** | **Red** & **Orange** | **Rapid, chaotic flicker or fast pulse.** Mimics the visual chaos and urgency of a real fire. The combination of red and orange is highly distinct. |
| ‡§ò‡•Å‡§∏‡§™‡•à‡§†‡§ø‡§Ø‡§æ **Intruder / Break-in** | **Bright White** | **Aggressive, fast strobe.** A strobing white light is highly disorienting and attention-grabbing, acting as a deterrent and a clear alert. |
| ‚öïÔ∏è **Medical Emergency** | **Solid Cyan** (Light Blue) | **Slow, steady "heartbeat" pulse.** A calm, non-threatening color with a gentle pulse to signal that help is needed without causing widespread panic. |
| ‚ö†Ô∏è **Gas / CO Leak** | **Canary Yellow** | **Slow "breathing" fade (on and off).** Yellow is universally associated with caution. The slow, methodical pattern indicates a serious but non-violent threat. |

### **Implementation Guidelines**

* **Primary Signal Location:** The protocol should be activated on highly visible, outdoor-facing lights such as **porch lights**, garage coach lights, or lights in a front-facing window.  
* **Smart Home Integration:** Triggers should be linked to certified smart devices (e.g., smart smoke alarms, security sensors, dedicated panic buttons) within smart home platforms. For instance, a routine could state: "WHEN Nest Protect detects smoke, THEN activate HELP Fire Protocol on front porch light."  
* **Manual Override:** The homeowner must be able to easily and deliberately deactivate the signal from their smart home app or voice assistant to prevent it from continuing after the emergency is resolved.  
* **Public Awareness:** For the system to be effective, it would need a public education campaign and a simple, recognizable window decal for participating homes. This would inform neighbors and first responders that the home is equipped with the HELP system.
