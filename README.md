# The-Home-Emergency-Light-Protocol-HELP-Standard
HELP is a proposed open, royalty-free, and universal standard for using consumer smart lighting to signal domestic emergencies. The goal of this public initiative is to create a simple visual language that can save lives, improve accessibility, and make our communities safer.  
This repository contains the complete proposal and technical specification, published defensively to ensure it remains an open standard for all.
The Problem: A Silent Safety Gap
Traditional smoke and security alarms are auditory only, leaving the deaf and hard-of-hearing vulnerable. Furthermore, a generic siren gives neighbors and first responders no context about the nature of an emergency. Is it a fire? An intruder? A medical issue? This ambiguity can cost precious time.
The Solution: A Universal Visual Language
The HELP standard leverages the millions of smart, color-capable lights already in our homes. By standardizing a few distinct patterns, these lights can become life-saving beacons.
The Core HELP Signals
Emergency Event
Color(s)
Pattern & Rationale
üî• Fire / Smoke
Red & Orange
Rapid, chaotic flicker. Mimics the visual chaos of a real fire, conveying maximum urgency.
üö® Intruder / Break-in
Bright White
Aggressive, fast strobe. Disorienting for intruders and a clear, universally understood attention signal.
‚öïÔ∏è Medical Emergency
Cyan (Light Blue)
Slow, steady "heartbeat" pulse. A calm signal that help is needed without causing widespread panic.
‚ö†Ô∏è Gas / CO Leak
Canary Yellow
Slow "breathing" fade. Yellow is a universal caution color, and the slow pattern indicates a serious but non-violent threat.

How to Get Involved
This is a public call for collaboration. We need expertise from:
Engineers at smart home and lighting companies.
Experts from standards bodies (ISO, IEC).
Advocates from accessibility and public safety organizations.
The public to provide feedback and build support.
Please see our Contribution Guide to learn how you can help.
Project Status
This project is currently in the proposal stage. The specifications are published here to build a coalition of partners to ratify, adopt, and promote the standard.
